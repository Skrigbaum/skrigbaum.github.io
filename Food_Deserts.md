## Executive Summary

There are 2.3 million Americans who cannot reliably buy healthy and nutritious food for their families. The areas that they live in do not have grocery stores or supermarkets that sell healthy food options. Instead, they are forced to purchase from convenience stores and gas stations, where healthy food is limited, and all food prices are inflated compared to grocery stores found elsewhere in the same region. These areas of limited healthy food options are called Food Deserts.

Food Deserts are caused by a host of different factors but there are a few major causes that stand out. The communities that are affected by Food Deserts typically are those of low-income and minorities that do not have reliable access to public transportation or vehicles of their own. The lack of transportation combined with the closing of many local “mom & pop” style small businesses that previously supplied healthy food for these communities makes the task of traveling to get healthy food very challenging.

The low-quality food that these communities are living off cause a dramatic shift in the health of the community. The rate of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity are higher than in other similar areas with access to healthy food. The lack of nutritious food also leads to a higher risk of malnutrition in children which leads to poor school performance.

There are things we can do to fix these Food Desert, however. Pushing for community collaboration and support around community gardens, community sourced agriculture (CSA’s), and meals on wheels program are a great first step. These programs can be assisted by working with nonprofits such as the Democratic Socialists of America who do outreach to communities affected by these types of issues.

## What is a Food Desert?

Imagine heading home from a long shift at work, and you have to take the bus today; the car gave out again. You need to get groceries but that's an additional 45 minutes’ worth of stops before you even get to the store. It'd be hours before you got home and you're already tired. There's a gas station not too far from home and they have some food, and there's that fast food place just down the road. Probably easier to just go there... That is a day to day choice for many who live in Food Deserts.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines Food Deserts as "an area with no ready access to a store with fresh and nutritious food options within one mile. In rural America, a food desert is defined as 10 miles or more from the nearest market” ("A Town Called Malnourished", 2014). This definition is sometimes expanded to include a lack of any food sources within 1 or 10 miles. A closely related issue that sometimes gets included in the definition of Food Deserts are Food Swamps; where there is plenty of access to food, but the food is primarily unhealthy options. 

Food deserts can affect urban, suburban, and rural areas in the United States. The biggest factor for an area being a Food Desert is the rate of poverty in that area. Apart from very dense urban areas, another signifier for Food Deserts is the percentage of the minority population ("Characteristics and Influential", 2012). However, areas in the Northeast are less likely to suffer from Food Deserts, a study in 2012 found the following: "This might reflect the relative proximity of rural tracts in the Northeast to urban tracts (that contain grocery stores), compared with the more sparsely populated rural areas in the South, Midwest, and West." ("Characteristics and Influential", 2012).

The Economic Research Service of the U.S.D.A found that about 2.3 million people (2.2 percent of the U.S. population) live more than a mile away from a grocery store or supermarket and do not own a car ("Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food", 2009). In addition, the study found that 23.5 million people live in low-income areas that are further than 1 mile from a grocery store and 11.5 million of these people were low income themselves. While the 23.5 million people may not be directly affected by the Food Desert because they may have transportation to get to grocery stores or supermarkets, it does put them at risk because a loss of their transportation could restrict their options for food.

## What are the Causes?

The reason that Food Deserts exist is not easily attributed to just one thing. There are many factors that go into creating one. The lack of transportation be it by not owning a car or inadequate public transportation can make it difficult for people to get to grocery stores. These stores are often on the outskirts or suburbs of cities due to the increasing amount of area needed to house these "super" stores. As these stores get larger more square footage is needed, more space for parking lots and proper roads to support large supply trucks, which pushes them farther from the city interior. In the past "Mom & Pop" style corner stores used to be more common and provided healthy food options to their communities, but many of these stores have gone out of business due to larger "super" stores.

Another major factor that is specifically a socio-economic issue is that low-income and minority communities tend to have significantly fewer grocery stores. This is caused by a combination of factors, one of which is that urban areas are very dense and do not have room for large grocery stores to be built. Another factor is that the people in these areas do not have the disposable income to compete with more wealthy areas and it becomes a better business strategy to build more grocery stores in wealthy communities to capitalize on their spending habits. This monetary drive may also explain why poor communities can pay up to 10% more for the same items at their convenience stores than wealthier neighborhoods pay at their grocery stores.

## What are the Effects?

The low-quality food that is often the only option in Food Deserts has substantial health impacts on those communities. These low-income and often minority communities suffer some of the highest rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes due to these high calorie, poor quality diets. Even cancer rates are increased in these communities due to being overweight or obese ("National Cancer Institute", 2017). These poor diets also tend to be low in nutritional value which can lead to overeating and malnutrition. These low nutrient diets can have severe impacts on children and even babies as lack of proper nutrients can lead to developmental issues and potential severe birth defects.

These issues can cause a spiral that many can't easily come out of. Poor health leads to more costs as many people in these communities do not have health insurance and are forced to pay out of pocket. This squeezes their expenses more forcing them to choose cheap, unhealthy options to eat. This is also a generational spiral as growing up in a family that eats unhealthily makes it much more likely that you also eat unhealthy foods as that is what you are used to.

This generational spiral also has wider implications as a poor diet growing up can have permanent effects. Malnutrition or even just specific nutritional deficiencies can reduce cognitive development and lead to a host of health issues some of which can be permanent. If growing up you are developing slowly or even something as simple as being constantly hungry, your ability to learn is severely compromised. The reduction in learning capacity can affect whole schools in communities living in Food Deserts and can reflect poorly on the school and the ability of the children even though neither is to blame.

## How Can We Fix This?

There are some solutions that are being tested in communities to help alleviate the effects of a Food Desert. Some rural communities have begun getting their food from the local Community Supported Agriculture (CSA's). Many of the CSA's can be ordered online and delivered to locations throughout a community and some even deliver right to your door. This has the benefit of also supporting Another solution that is being tested is a mobile food pantry program which can help bring food directly to the people. Community gardens are another solution that is being utilized in some communities as a supplement to their regular diets and has seen good results.

The possibility of either the Federal or State government providing incentives to gas stations and corner stores to stock healthier food is a solution that was suggested and recently begun to catch more attention. Large scale year-round community gardens or community farms have been another solution building upon the success of smaller-scale community gardens. Setting up proper zoning laws for urban agriculture could be another solution, as the use of abandoned lots for community food could go a long way to providing locally grown healthy food options.

One of the single biggest changes that would help those who live in Food Deserts is a better implemented and funded public transportation system. While not perfect, the public transit system that is better funded can provide more options and better routes to help the communities. Another major change would be the incentivizing of grocery stores to open and operate smaller stores in these Food Deserts and to make sure a large portion of their goods were healthy and nutritious choices.
