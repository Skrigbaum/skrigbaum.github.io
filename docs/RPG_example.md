# Rules Snippet for Character Creation in Upcoming RPG

## Attribute Scores
The attribute scores follow the standard modern D&D pattern of:
```
Strength (STR)
Dexterity (DEX)
Constitution (CON)
Intelligence (INT)
Wisdom (WIS)
Charisma (CHA)
*OPTIONAL Rule*: Luck (LUCK)
 ```

- These attributes range from 1-100 with 1 being the worst and 100 being the best.

- They are rolled in order via *2d10+40*

- Next to each stat is also a spot for an attribute modifier, this is determined via the 10's digit of the associated attribute.
Example: *A Strength of 46 would have a modifier of 4*

## Background
A background is representative of what it was that your character did before becoming an adventurer. These backgrounds grant Starting Equipment as well as providing a fictional hook that be can used in game.

In addition Backgrounds can be used during skill rolls to provide a bonus (5% - 15% to targeted Attribute) based on whether the experiences in your pre-adventure life would help you. The exact bonus is determined by the GM.

## Heritage & Culture
This is the people from who you descend from biologically and those that rose you. Heritage refers to biological traits such as infra-vision or stature. Culture refers to skills and cultural norms you picked up such as ability to read Magic Runes, or underground sense of direction.

## Classes
Classes are the primary way in which abilities, features, and specialization are acquired. 
* Basic Classes are broken into 4 levels, 0-3. 
* Advanced and Rare Classes are broken down into 3 levels, 1-3. 
* Classes give features such as: 
	* Proficiencies
	* Abilities
	* Stat increases
## Levels 
Levels are unlocked via Experience Gain. Each level grants 2-3 abilities; many of which can be used in conjunction with other Class abilities to create a unique feeling character.
* Implicit Abilities are not transferable to other Classes
* Only one Capstone Ability can be added to your Feature Slots at a time.

## Feature Slots
A feature slot can be used to store an ability from any class and make it useable for that day. 
* In addition to the abilities granted by your Class you also gain Feature Slots for every **three** Tiers you gain. 
* Upon achieving **Tier 1** you gain **one** feature slot which you can fill with another ability from another Class which you have unlocked.
| Total Ranks | Feature Slots |
| ------| --------------|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
| 4| 2|
| 5| 2|
| 6| 3|
| etc. | etc. |


## Tiers
Character level in the traditional sense do not exist in this system. Instead as you move up class levels you gain 1 "Tier" per class you have cleared. This number can be used roughly as a "power level" for your characters and can be a useful way to gauge party skill when designing encounters.

## Experience Points (XP)
To gain XP there are three major routes to do so: Spending Gold, Completing non-combat objectives, and killing monsters.
* Spent gold is converted 1GP - 1XP
* Non-combat objectives refer to feats of exploration: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EgF5H4ERSwOKIrj8ZBQiUVjP8ZDapEcaoucUNmVj4pE/edit#gid=0
* Monsters give XP based on HD of creatures in the encounter. See DM section for more info.

## Alignment
*Tentative based on setting* - Alignment operates on the MTG scale where each color correlates to different priorities and combinations of these colors create unique motivations.

## Health Points (HP)
Base HP is based on your heritage and modified by your background. Further HP gains are based on the Class you are Ranking up.
* Orc Farmer: 1d8(orc) + 3 (farmer)
