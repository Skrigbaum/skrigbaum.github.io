My name is Spencer Krigbaum,

 I'm a Software Engineer with 6 years of experience looking to move into the world of Technical Writing. Throughout my time as a Software Engineer I've been exposed to varying qualities of documentation and technical writing, and relying on these varying qualities of documentation has instilled a deep respect for high quality technical writing. 
 
 In college I took a wide array of writing courses including technical writing, and I have previously worked as a Features Writer for a Gaming Journalism website. This page provides an overview of several technical writing projects, as well as samples I have developed specifically for this website.
