My name is Spencer Krigbaum, I'm a Software Engineer looking to move into the world of Technical Writing. Throughout my time as a Software Engineer I've been exposed to varying qualities of documentation and technical writing, and I'm looking to make the world of documentation better for everyone. In college I took a wide array of writing courses including technical writing, and I have previously worked as a Features Writer for a Gaming Journalism website. This page provides an overview of several technical writing projects, as well as samples I have developed specifically for this website.
